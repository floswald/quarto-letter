I am writing to strongly support the application to your program of {{< var first >}} {{< var LAST >}}. I have known {{< var first >}} for 3 years in my capacity as Professor at [SciencesPo Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/) before I moved to Turin, as well as in my role as Data Editor for the RES journals EJ and EctJ, where {{< var first >}} is a member of my team. That is to say, I know {{< var pro4 >}} much better than I would know the average graduate student.

Let me start out with {{< var first >}} as my student at SciencesPo. He sat and performed exceedingly well in both of my graduate courses [Introduction to Programming](https://floswald.github.io/ScPoProgramming) and [Computational Economics](https://floswald.github.io/NumericalMethods/). The first of those lays the foundations that are needed to become a successful researcher/datascientist nowadays, while the second course takes those as given and teaches students how to deal with economic models which are non-trivial to compute. You will see that the material is quite comprehensive and is what I think the standard toolkit of any successful researcher in social sciences should contain. I start from basically zero, but I expose students a lot of material in relatively little time, trying to keep everyone on board, and {{< var first >}} has done great not getting discouraged, and indeed came top of the class in both instances.

I also talked about research ideas with {{< var first >}}. He has an interest in Urban Economics, my own field, and we discussed his idea for a master thesis, which would analyse house price responses in Poland caused by influx of Ukrainian refugees in recent times; This represents an enormous housing demand shock, and {{< var first >}} was very productive in chasing up interesting datasets, which helped him tackle this question.
I highly recommended him last year as a collaborator for the ERC project RUSTDEC headed by Andre Groeger at UAB, and his application was successful. {{< var first >}} is currently working in the realm of that project on a large array of geospatial data with cutting edge tools, spanning R, python, Julia and stata. I am convinced that this is an outstanding opportunity to do frontier research and that {{< var first >}} benefits greatly from the experience.

Let me now move on to describe {{< var first >}} as one of my replicators at the RES reproducibility organisation, which I manage. We check that each paper accepted for publication in the Economic Journal (EJ) and the Econometrics Journal (EctJ) is reproducible. I have relied, and I keep relying, on the painstaking and technically very demanding work of {{< var first >}} in his role as one of my most senior replicators. He is clearly part of a small group of highly skilled replicators, very responsive, eager to tackle hard packages (which could mean, for instance, to learn from basic FORTAN to run some package - which was his case), and with a great capacity to quickly analyse very complex problems. Based on my experience with him in this role alone, I can highly recommend {{< var first >}} for any econ graduate program out there, including the very best. You can infer that, taken together with my experience with {{< var first >}} as a grad student at SciencesPo, my recommendation is that much stronger still. 

I am excited to see what {{< var first >}} will be up in the future, I know with a very high degree of certainty that he has all the relevant skills for a top graduate student. I am happy that I was able to have him in class and on my team of replicators. I assure you that he would make a great addition to your graduate program, and I urge you not to miss this opportunity.

Please do not hesitate to get in touch with any further questions.
